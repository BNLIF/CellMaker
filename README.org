#+TITLE: CellMaker
A Wire-Cell Generator and Visualization Tool for LArTPC Experiments

* Description

This tool takes a set of wire-plane geometry parameters, either as command-line inputs or as hard-coded =const= parameters in =CellMaker.cpp=, and constructs a set of cells that represent possible {Y,Z} coordinates for ionization electrons detected at a given time using a three-plane LArTPC.  Along the way, the vertices, center point, and area of each cell are computed, as well as associations with collection-plane wires.  The tool also provides a means to visualize the resulting cell map.  The cells are stored in containers within the program code and can eventually be saved into a ROOT file for further reconstruction needs.

* Building Code

Building =CellMaker.cpp= is very straightforward.  Simply run the following command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ make
#+END_EXAMPLE

* How To Use Tool

After making modifications to the =const= parameters in =CellMaker.cpp= to represent the details of the geometry of the LArTPC setup of interest, build the code as instructed above.  Then run CellMaker with the following command-line input parameters:

1. (=Double_t=) The angle of the U wires with respect to the Y wires (positive, 0 to 90 degrees)
2. (=Double_t=) The angle of the V wires with respect to the Y wires (also positive, 0 to 90 degrees)
3. (=Int_t=) The total number of Y wires
4. (=Int_t=) Visualization mode for illustrating cell map (0 for no visualization, 1 for visualization of geometry, 2 for visualization of cells with real hits, and 3 for visualization of real hits, fake hits, and wires with non-zero charge)

If parameter #4 is set to anything but =0=, then a =.png= file will be created.  As an example, to create a cell map with the U and V wires at 60 degrees with respect to the Y wires, with 30 Y wires in total, and outputting a plot visualizing the cell map, run the following command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./CellMaker 60 60 30 1
#+END_EXAMPLE
